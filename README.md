## 1. Overview

In order to complete the project we program in Python the different ROS nodes. The basic structure is well described in the Udacity Walkthrough, and our implementations follows the given guidelines. This implements the basic functionality of loading the Waypoints that the car has to follow, controlling the car movement along these Waypoints, and stop the car upon encountering a red traffic light. The details of the ROS system is described in [System architecture](#system-architecture).

After laying out the basic ROS functionality, much focus was given to implement the traffic light detection from images collected by the camera, both on the simulator and on the real testing lot. We decided in favor to use a Tensorflow model pre-trained on the general task of object detection. To prepare for this part of the project we read the previous work of [Alex Lechner](https://github.com/alex-lechner/Traffic-Light-Classification) on the Udacity Nanodegree, as well as the Medium post of [Vatsal Srivastava](https://becominghuman.ai/traffic-light-detection-tensorflow-api-c75fdbadac62). We also used their datasets for test and validation.

To fine-tune this model to our task of recognizing traffic lights (red, yellow, and green) we generated thousands of labeled training images. 

The training on those images was done using the Tensorflow Object Detection API and Google Cloud Platform, as described in [Traffic Light Classifier](#traffic-light-classifier).

The integration of our Tensorflow Traffic Light Classifier into the ROS system is described in [Final Integration](#final-integration).

## 2. System Architecture

The ROS system can be divided in three main subsystems:

- **Perception:** detects traffic lights and classifies them into red, yellow, green, or unknown
- **Planning:** loads the circuit waypoints and update the waypoint list in front of our car
- **Control:** makes the car to actually move along the waypoints by controlling the car's throttle, steer, and brake using PID controller and low pass filter

The diagram below shows the subsystem division, as well as the ROS nodes and topics.

- nodes: are single process within the ROS graph. The main nodes that we worked on, or completed from the Udacity repository, were:
	- **tl_detector:** in the perception subsystem.
	- **waypoint_updater:** in the planning subsystem
	- **dbw_node:** in the control subsystem
- topics: are named buses over which nodes send and receive messages, by subscribing or publishing to them.

<img src="imgs/final-project-ros-graph-v2.png" width="100%" height="100%" /> 

### i. Perception (tl_detector.py)

This node subscribes to four topics:
- `/base_waypoints`: provides the complete list of waypoints for the course.
- `/current_pose`: determines the vehicle's location.
- `/image_color`: provides an image stream from the car's camera. 
- `/vehicle/traffic_lights`: provides the (x, y, z) coordinates of all traffic lights.

This node will find the waypoint of the closest traffic light in front of the car. This point will be described by its index counted from the car (e.g.: the number 12 waypoint ahead of the car position). Then, the state of the traffic light will be acquired from the camera image in `/image_color` using the classifier implementation in `tl_classifier.py`. If the traffic light is red, it will publish the waypoint index into the `/traffic_waypoint` topic. This information will be taken by the Planning subsystem to define the desired velocity at the next sequence of waypoints.

### ii. Planning (waypoint_updater.py)

This node subscribes to the topics:
- `/base_waypoints`: list of all waypoints for the track
- `/current_pose`: the current position coordinates of our car
- `/traffic_waypoint`: waypoint list of the traffic light in our circuit

It publishes a list of waypoints in front of our car to the topic `/final_waypoints`. The data in waypoints also includes the desired velocity of the car at the given waypoint. If a red traffic light is detected in front of the car, we modify the desired velocity of the `/final_waypoints` up to it in a way that the car slowly stops at the right place.

The number of waypoints is defined by the parameter `LOOKAHEAD_WPS`. If this parameter is too big, there is a big latency updating the waypoints, in a way that the car gets ahead of the list of way points. This confuses the control of the car, which tries to follow the waypoints. We set for a value of 20, to get rid of this latency while still having enough data to properly control the car.

### iii. Control (dbw_node.py)

In the control subsystem, Udacity provides an [Autoware](https://www.autoware.org/) software `waypoint_follower.py`. After publishing `/final_waypoints` this software publishes twist commands to the `/twist_cmd` topic, that contain the desired linear and angular velocities.

`dbw_node.py` subscribes to `/twist_cmd`, `/current_velocity`, and `/vehicle/dbw_enabled`. It passes the messages in these nodes to the `Controller` class from `twist_controller.py`. We implemented here the control of the car, using the provided Yaw Controller, PID Controller, and LowPass Filter.

It is important to perfom the control only when `/vehicle/dbw_enabled` is true. When this topic message is false, it means the car is on manual control. In this condition the PID controller would mistakenly accumulate error.

The calculated throttle, brake, and steering are published to the topics:
- `/vehicle/throttle_cmd`
- `/vehicle/brake_cmd`
- `/vehicle/steering_cmd`

## 3. Traffic Light Classifier

The state of the traffic light in front of the car has to be extracted from the camera's images, both on the simulator and at the real site. Different methods of image recognition can be used. We decided to use Deep Learning in the form of a model pre-trained on the general task of object detection. While previously, in this Udacity nanodegree, we defined a model from scratch and trained it for traffic sign classification, object detection also includes the capability of locating an object within an image and delimiting its position on a bounding box. Only this way can we extract from the camera image the state of one or several traffic light within the landscape in front of us.

Several Deep Learning methods for [object detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_detection) have been developed by researchers. Two of the most popular methods are [R-CNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2524) (Regions with CNN), and [SSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325) (Single Shot Detector). While R-CNN performs with higher accuracy than SSD, the latter is faster. Improved versions have been developed (Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN) but they are still slower than SSD.

The Google's [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) provides a great framework to implement our traffic light classifier. This is a collection of pre-trained models and high level subroutines that facilitate the use and fine-tuning of these models. The models are compiled in [Tensorflow detection model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md), belonging mainly to the SSD and Faster R-CNN methods.

Although the goal of the API is to facilitate the fine-tune training of these model, there are still a lot of installation and configuration steps that are not trivial at all. Actually, by the time you have fully trained a model for your purposes you will have gone through a convoluted series of steps, and probably several errors. There is extensive information on the [API Readme](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/README.md). However, this information is general and in some parts lacks detail for our concrete task. So, we find useful to include belowa detailed tutorial describing our experience

On a high level, the steps to take are:
- [Tensorflow Object Detection API Installation](#tensorflow-object-detection-api-installation)
- [Choose and test a model from the Model Zoo](#choose-and-test-a-model-from-the-model-zoo)
- [Configure the pipeline.config file](#configure-the-pipelineconfig-file)
- [Test the training process locally](#test-the-training-process-locally)
- [Train with GPUs using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](#train-with-gpus-using-google-cloud-platform-gcp)
- [Export and test the final graph](#export-and-test-the-final-graph)

### i. Tensorflow Object Detection API Installation

  (You find the [official reference](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md) here)

1. Install TensorFlow:

	```pip install tensorflow```

2. Install required libraries:
	```
	sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler python-pil python-lxml python-tk
	pip install --user Cython
	pip install --user contextlib2
	pip install --user jupyter
	pip install --user matplotlib
	```

3. Create a new directory ``tensorflow``

4. Clone the entire [models GitHub repository](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) from the``tensorflow`` directory. 

	```git clone https://github.com/tensorflow/models.git```
	
	This will take 1.2 GB on disk, as it contains models for many different tasks (NLP, GAN, ResNet...). Our model is found in `/tensorflow/models/research/object_detection/`, and many of the commands below will be input from `/tensorflow/models/research/

5. Install COCO API
	```
	# From tensorflow/models/research/
	git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git
	cd cocoapi/PythonAPI
	make
	cp -r pycocotools <path_to_tensorflow>/models/research/
	```

6. Compile Protobuf
	```
	# From tensorflow/models/research/
	protoc object_detection/protos/*.proto --python_out=.
	```
	
7. Add libraries to PYTHONPATH
	```
	# From tensorflow/models/research/
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim
	```

8. If you run without errors until here, test your installation with 
	```
	python object_detection/builders/model_builder_test.py
	```

Once installed, the API provides the following tools and scripts that we will use to fine-tune a model with our data:

- An inference script in the form of a Jupyter Notebook, to detect objects on an image from a "frozen_inference_graph.pb" ([Object Detection Demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb))
- Tools to create TFRecord files from original data ([dataset tools](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection/dataset_tools))
- A training script to fine-tune a pre-trained model with our own dataset, locally or in Google Cloud ([model_main.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/model_main.py))
- A script to export a new "frozen_inference_graph.pb" from a fine-tuned model ([export_inference_graph.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/export_inference_graph.py))


### ii. Choose and test a model from the Model Zoo
(You find the [official reference](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) here)

In the model zoo you find a list of pre-trained models to download, as well as some basic stats regarding accuracy and speed. These models are pre-trained with datasets like the [COCO dataset](http://cocodataset.org/#home) or the [Open Images dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html). The COCO dataset, for example, consists of more than 200K images, with 1.5 object instances labeled within them, belonging to 80 different object categories.

Each pre-trained model contains:
- a checkpoint (`model.ckpt.data-00000-of-00001`, `model.ckpt.index`, `model.ckpt.meta`)
- a frozen graph (`frozen_inference_graph.pb`) to be used for out of the box inference 
- a config file (`pipeline.config`) 

The pre-trained model can already be tested for inference. As it is not fine-tuned for our requirements (detect traffic lights and classify them into red, yellow, or green), the results will not be satisfactory for us. However is a good exercise to get familiarized with the inference script in the [Object Detection Demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/object_detection_tutorial.ipynb) Jupyter notebook. This notebook downloads the model automatically for you. If you download it manually to a directory of your choice, as you will need to work with it when fine-tuning, you can comment out the lines in the "Download Model" section and input the correct local path in
```
PATH_TO_FROZEN_GRAPH = MODEL_NAME + '/frozen_inference_graph.pb'
```

As it happens that the COCO dataset includes "Traffic Light" as an object category, when we run the inference script with one of our images, this class will probably be recognized. However, the model as it is will not be able to classify the traffic light state. Below you can see the result on a general picture and on one of our pictures out of the simulator.

### iii. Configure the pipeline.config file

 (You find the [official reference](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/configuring_jobs.md) here)
 
The parameters to configure the training and evaluation process are described in the `pipeline.config` file. When you download the model you get the configuration corresponding to the pre-training. 

The `pipeline.config` file has five sections: model{...}, train_config{...}, train_input_reader{...}, eval_config{...}, and eval_input_reader{...}. These sections contain parameters pertaining to the model training (dropout, dimensions...), and the training and evaluation process and data.
 
 This can be used for our fine-tuning with some modifications:
 
- On model{...}:
	- Change `num_classes: 90` to the number of classes that we are going to train the model on. In our case these are the four described in our `label_map.pbtxt`, ('red', 'green', 'yellow', 'unknown')
	- `max_detections_per_class: 100` and `max_total_detections: 300` to `max_detections_per_class: 10` and `max_total_detections: 10`
- On train_config{...}:
	- `fine_tune_checkpoint: "PATH_TO_BE_CONFIGURED/model.ckpt"` to the directory where you placed the pre-trained model
	- `num_steps: 200000` to `num_steps: 20000`
- On eval_config{...}:
	- Set `num_examples` to the number of images in your evaluation data
- On train_input_reader{...} and eval_input_reader{...}
	- `PATH_TO_BE_CONFIGURED` placeholders in `input_path` and `label_map_path` set to your .record files and `label_map.pbtxt`

If you follow this tutorial, you will first set your paths to your local folders to train the model locally. However, when you go to train the model on the cloud, you have to remember to change the paths to you GCP buckets, as described below.

### iv. Test the training process locally

 (You find the [official reference](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_locally.md) here)
 
Training without a GPU will take really too long to be practical and, even though I have a GPU on my computer, I didn't figure out how to use it with this API. Anyway, running locally is useful to test your setup, as there are lots of thing that can go wrong and the latency when sending a work to the cloud can delay a lot your debugging.

Training is done using the script `model_main.py` in `tensorflow/models/research/object_detection/`. The script needs the training and evaluation data, as well as the `pipeline.config`, as described above. You will send some parameters to the script in the command line. So, first set the following environment variables from the terminal.

```
PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH={path to pipeline config file}
MODEL_DIR={path to fine-tuned model directory}
NUM_TRAIN_STEPS=50000
SAMPLE_1_OF_N_EVAL_EXAMPLES=1
```

`MODEL_DIR` points to a new folder where you want to save your new fine-tuned model. The path to the pre-trained model is already specified in your `pipeline.config` under the `fine_tune_checkpoint` parameter.

Feel free to set a lower number for `NUM_TRAIN_STEPS`, as you will not have the patience to run 50000. In my system 1000 was a good number for testing purposes.

Finally, you can run the script using Python from the command line:

```
# From the tensorflow/models/research/ directory
python object_detection/model_main.py \
    --pipeline_config_path=${PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH} \
    --model_dir=${MODEL_DIR} \
    --num_train_steps=${NUM_TRAIN_STEPS} \
    --sample_1_of_n_eval_examples=$SAMPLE_1_OF_N_EVAL_EXAMPLES \
    --alsologtostderr
```

### v. Train with GPUs using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

 (You find the [official reference](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/running_on_cloud.md) here)

Although you can use any cloud service like Amazon's AWS or Microsoft's Azure, we though Google Cloud would have better compatibility with Google's Tensorflow API. To use it you first need to setup your own GCP account. You will get 200$ of credit with your new GCP account, which will be more than enough to do all the work in this tutorial.

The details of setting up your GCP account (not trivial) are out of the scope of this tutorial, but you basically need to create a project, where your work will be executed, and a bucket, where your data will be stored. Check the following official documentation:
- [Getting started](https://cloud.google.com/gcp/getting-started/)
- [Create a Linux VM](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/quickstart-linux)
- [Create a bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/quickstart-console)
- [Train a TensorFlow Model](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/tensorflow/getting-started-training-prediction)

After this, running a training work on the cloud is very similar to running it locally, with the following additional steps:
- Packaging: The script are currently stored in your computer, not on the cloud. At running time you will send them to the cloud and run it there. This will be sent in the form of packages that you create by:
	```
	# From tensorflow/models/research/
	bash object_detection/dataset_tools/create_pycocotools_package.sh /tmp/pycocotools
	python setup.py sdist
	(cd slim && python setup.py sdist)
	```
- Create YAML configuration file: this file describes the GPUs setup you will use on the cloud. You can just create a text file with the following content:
	```
	trainingInput:
	  runtimeVersion: "1.12"
	  scaleTier: CUSTOM
	  masterType: standard_gpu
	  workerCount: 9
	  workerType: standard_gpu
	  parameterServerCount: 3
	  parameterServerType: standard
	```
- Upload your data and pre-trained model to your bucket: you can either use the command line with `gsutil cp ...` or the web GUI on your buckets page.
- Modify and upload your `pipeline.config`: change the paths for the model and data to the corresponding location in your bucket in the form `gs://PRE-TRAINED_MODEL_DIR` and `gs://DATA_DIR`
- Define or redefine the following environment variable in your terminal:
	```
	PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH={path to pipeline config file}
	MODEL_DIR={path to fine-tuned model directory}
	NUM_TRAIN_STEPS=50000
	SAMPLE_1_OF_N_EVAL_EXAMPLES=1
	```
- Send the training job to the cloud with the command:
	```
	# From tensorflow/models/research/
	gcloud ml-engine jobs submit training object_detection_`date +%m_%d_%Y_%H_%M_%S` \
	    --runtime-version 1.12 \
	    --job-dir=gs://${MODEL_DIR} \
	    --packages dist/object_detection-0.1.tar.gz,slim/dist/slim-0.1.tar.gz,/tmp/pycocotools/pycocotools-2.0.tar.gz \
	    --module-name object_detection.model_main \
	    --region us-central1 \
	    --config ${PATH_TO_LOCAL_YAML_FILE} \
	    -- \
	    --model_dir=gs://${MODEL_DIR} \
	    --pipeline_config_path=gs://${PIPELINE_CONFIG_PATH}
	    --num_train_steps=${NUM_TRAIN_STEPS}
	    --sample_1_of_n_eval_examples=$SAMPLE_1_OF_N_EVAL_EXAMPLES
	    --alsologtostderr
	```
